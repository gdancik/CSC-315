# Lab 7: Hypothesis testing for population means.
# For these questions, we will assume that the Central 
# Limit Theorem applies (i.e., that the populations are normally 
# distributed or that 'n' is sufficiently large), and that the 
# samples are representative of the population of interest.

# 1. Is there evidence that a student's college GPA differs from his/her
# high school GPA? We can test this by evaluating whether or
# not the mean difference between GPAs differs from 0. 

diff = survey$College.GPA-survey$HS.GPA

# (a) State the null and alternative hypotheses (done for you):

# H0: mu_diff = 0
# HA: mu_diff != 0

# where mu_diff is the mean difference between college and high school GPAs

# (b) Calculate / find the test statistic (and specify the degrees of freedom)

# (c) Find the p-value using t.test

# (d) Find the p-value 'manually' based on the test statistic and
#     appropriate degrees of freedom 

# (e) State the conclusion regarding the null and alternative hypotheses in 
#     the context of this problem.

# 2. Is there evidence that the college GPA of a 'cat' person 
# differs from that of a 'dog' person?

# (a) State the null and alternative hypotheses (done for you):

#   H0: mu_cat - mu_dog = 0
#   HA: mu_cat - mu_dog != 0,

#   where mu_cat and mu_dog are the mean college GPAs for students preferring
#   cats and dogs, respectively

# (b) Create side-by-side boxplots (using ggplot) showing College GPA for 'cat' and
#     'dog' people. Make sure to label the y-axis and give the 
#     chart a title.

# (c) We will now formally test the hypotheses that mean college GPA
#     is different between 'cat' and 'dog' people. The command 
#     t.test(x,y) will perform a two-sample t-test for the null 
#     hypothesis that the 'x' and 'y' populations have the same mean.
#     Use the t.test function to find the test statistic and the 
#     corresponding degrees of freedom. Note that in your call to t.test,
#     'x' is a vector of College GPAs for 'cat' people and 'y' is a 
#     vector of College GPAs for 'dog' people

# (d) Find the p-value from the result of the t.test function

# (e) Find the p-value 'manually' based on the test statistic and
#     appropriate degrees of freedom from the t.test result (which 
#     is stored in the $parameter object)

# (f) State the conclusion regarding the null and alternative hypotheses in 
#     the context of this problem.

# (g) What would it mean in the context of this problem if a Type I 
#     error occurred?

# 4:  The 'sugars' column contains the sugar content (in grams), while
#     the 'shelf' column contains the shelf in which the cereal is 
#     shelved on, with 1 = lower shelf, 2 = middle shelf (which is at
#     eye level for children), and 3 = top shelf. The code below constructs
#     a boxplot comparing sugar content across the lower and middle shelves

# remove data from the top shelf (Note: make sure dplyr is loaded
# before running the next statement)
cereal <- filter(cereal, shelf != 3)

# change shelf column to factor
cereal$shelf <- factor(cereal$shelf)

  ggtitle("Sugar content in cereals by shelf level") + 
  labs(x = "shelf level", y = "sugar content (grams)")

# Now let's formally test whether mean sugar content differs
# between the lower shelf and the middle shelf.

# (a) State the null and alternative hypotheses

# (b) Use the t.test function to find the test statistic 
#     and corresponding degrees of freedom

# (c) Find the p-value

# (d) State the conclusion regarding the null and alternative hypotheses in 
#     the context of this problem.
