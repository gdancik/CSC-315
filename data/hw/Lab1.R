# Add R code to the script below in order to explicitly output the 
# answers to the following questions. Turn in this assignment
# by creating an HTML Notebook and submitting the Notebook through 
# Blackboard.
# Note: DO NOT delete / modify any of the questions / comments below!
##########################################################################

# 1) What is 34+29*12

# 2) What is the sum of all integers between (and including) -100 and +100.

# 3)	Create a vector that contains the numbers 1-10.

# 4) Change the 3rd value of the above vector to 99

# 5)	Create a vector that contains the numbers 1-10, 17, and 25.

# 6)	Create a vector that contains two elements, your first name and last name

# 7) Create a matrix that contains the numbers 87, 89, and 91 in the 1st row and
#   76, 88, and 83 in the second row. Set or change the column names to 
#   "ExamI", "ExamII", and "ExamIII", and set or change the row names to 
#   "Joseph Smith" and "Amy Davis"

# 8) Calculate the average grade for Amy Davis, using the 'mean' function.

# 9) "Joseph" prefers to be called "Joe". Change the name of the 1st row of the matrix 
#   to "Joe Smith". You should do this in a statement that only changes the name of 
#   the first row. Note that R allows you to directly assign a value to any element 
#   (or elements) of rownames(m).

# 10)	Create a list that includes the following objects: 
#       (1) a vector that contains two elements, your first name and last name; 
#       (2) your major

# 11)  Read in the survey.txt file as was done in class (and put the code for this in your script!)

# 12)	How many individuals surveyed did not use FB (i.e., spent 0 hours / week on FB)

# 13) What are the GPAs of the three students with the lowest College GPAs (you 
#    should only display these GPAs)? Hint: use the 'sort' function. 

# 14) What are the GPAs of the three students with the highest college GPAs? 
#    Hint: use the sort function with decreasing = TRUE

# 15) Use the 'filter' function from 'dplyr' to create a data frame (tibble) 
#    called surveyA that includes the students with a 3.5 college GPA or higher

# 16) Display the 'Gender' column from surveyA and comment on the number of 
#    individuals who are male, and the number who are female.

# 17) Create an HTML noteobok
