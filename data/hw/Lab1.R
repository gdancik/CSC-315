# Add R code to the script below and create a Notebook which explicitly 
# answers the following questions
##########################################################################

  
#1) What is 34+29*12

#2) What is the sum of all integers between (and including) -100 and +100.

#3)	Create a vector that contains the numbers 1-10.

#4)	Create a vector that contains the numbers 1-10, 17, and 25.

#5)	Create a vector that contains two elements, your first name and last name

#6) Create a matrix that contains the numbers 87, 89, and 91 in the 1st row and
#   76, 88, and 83 in the second row. Change the column names to "ExamI", "ExamII", and "ExamIII",
#   and change the row names to "Joseph Smith" and "Amy Davis"

#7) Calculate the average grade for Amy Davis, using the 'mean' function.

#8) "Joseph" prefers to be called "Joe". Change the name of the 1st row of the matrix 
#   to "Joe Smith" (you should do this in a statement that only changes the name of the first row)

#9)	Create a list that includes the following objects: 
#       (1) a vector that contains two elements, your first name and last name; 
#       (2) your age

#10)  Read in the survey.txt file as was done in class (and put the code for this in your script!)

#11)  How many of these individuals are male? How many are female?

#12)	How many individuals surveyed did not use FB (i.e., spent 0 hours / week on FB)

#13) What are the GPAs of the three students with the lowest College GPAs? Hint: use the sort function.
#     (Note: your answer to this question should display only these GPAs)

#14) What are the GPAs of the three students with the highest college GPAs? Hint: use the sort function with decreasing = TRUE

#15) Create a data.frame called survey.A that includes all students that have a 3.5 college GPA or higher

#16) How many of these individuals are male? How many are female?
