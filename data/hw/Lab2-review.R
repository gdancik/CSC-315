# 8. Out of the "Cat" people in this class, what has been their favorite
#    CSC course so far? Answer this question by first creating a new
#    data.frame for "Cat" people only. Then generate a relative frequency table
#    for favorite programming language. Then answer the same question for "Dog" 
#    people. What do you conclude about the favorite course for cat and dog people (for 
#    students in this class) based on this data?



# 9. Construct a histogram for Alchol consumption, by using the hist() function with the argument
#    breaks = 14 to set the number of groupings. Describe the shape of its distribution. 
#    Is it unimodal, bimodal, or flat. Is it skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric?


# 10. Calculate the mean and median for Alcohol consumption. 
#    Which is a better measure of averages? (Note: although these numbers are similar,
#    one would still be considered better than the other -- why?)


# 11. What is the 75th percentile for HS GPA??

# 12. Ten percent of indivduals have HS GPAs above what value?
