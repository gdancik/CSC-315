# Add R code to the script below and create a Notebook to complete
# the steps and explicitly answer the following questions

# Note: all graphs must be given an appropriate title, x-axis label, and
#   y-axis label
##########################################################################

# 1.load our classes survey data 
#   (available at https://gdancik.github.io/CSC-315/data/datasets/survey_fall-2017.csv)
#   and add the code for this to the script. 


# 2. How many students completed the survey?


# 3. How many questions were asked (i.e., how many columns are there)?


# 4. Construct a frequency bar graph for the response to "Are you a cat or a dog person?"
#    Remove the legend by adding the following component to the end of your 
#    ggplot() code: theme(legend.position = "none")


# 5. Construct a relative frequency table for favorite programming language


# 6. Construct a Pareto Chart for favorite programming language


# 7. Construct a relative frequency table for whether or not a student consumes alcohol
#    at least 1 day per week, on average (i.e., consumes alcohol > 0 days per week).


# 8. Out of the "Cat" people in this class, what proportion list "Python" as their 
#    favorite programming language? Answer this question by first creating a new
#    data.frame for "Cat" people only. Then generate a relative frequency table
#    for favorite programming language. Then answer the same question for "Dog" 
#    people. What do you conclude about programming language preference (for 
#    students in this class) based on this data?



# 9. Construct a histogram for Alchol consumption, by using the hist() function with the argument
#    breaks = 14 to set the number of groupings. Describe the shape of its distribution. 
#    Is it unimodal, bimodal, or flat. Is it skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric?


# 10. Calculate the mean and median for Alcohol consumption. 
#    Which is a better measure of averages? (Note: although these numbers are similar,
#    one would still be considered better than the other -- why?)


# 11. What is the 75th percentile for HS GPA??

# 12. Ten percent of indivduals have HS GPAs above what value?

# 13. Create side-by-side boxplots showing the College GPA based on
#     a person's favorite programming language.  Does there appear 
#     to be a significant difference in the GPAs between these 
#     groups? Are there any outliers? If so, how many?


# 14. For college GPA, what is the variance and standard deviation?


# 15. Create a vector with 4 values that has a standard deviation of 0.
